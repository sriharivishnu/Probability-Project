# Probability-Project
Project to calculate the probability of a theoretical game.


### Materials:
- 3 6-sided die (Numbered from 1-6)
- 30cm radius, circular, bordered playing area (so die cannot bounce outside of playing area)
- A 30cm Ruler 
- A random number generator (between 1-30)

### Goal: 
The last player standing wins (in other words, the other player has run out of lives).

### Setup:
  Before starting the game, designate one of the dice as the central die, and the other two as roller dice.

Roll the central die and then record its value. The number shown on the central die is the number of lives each player begins with. Then place the central die at the center of the container; this marks the central point of the board and it serves as a marker for the duration of the game. While playing, you must toss the other two dice 30cm directly above its position. The central dice will not be touched/rolled for the remainder of the game.

### GamePlay:

  Each round of the game consists of the following:

1. Each player drops one of the roller dice from directly above the central die. 
2. After each player drops their roller die, measure the distance in centimetres from the center of each roller die to the central die using the ruler as precise as possible, and then record the difference between the two measurements. 
3. Record the sum of the value of the faces shown on all three dice (including the central die as well). 
4. If the difference of the measurements is greater than the value shown on all three dice, player 1 loses a life. Otherwise, if the difference of the measurements is less than the value shown on all three dice, player 2 loses a life. 
5. If the sum of the rolls is the exact same, measure the lengths again to another decimal place.
6. Start the next round with each picking up the roller dice and tossing them again; make sure the central die is still in the central position of the playing area
7. Continue playing rounds until one of the players runs out of lives, at which point the other player wins the game.
